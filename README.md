## Screen Shots of app on local server
Here is my landing page, AAU, there are 2 entries into the site, if you have a unique key user will choose "JOIN A DJ BOOTH" (will explain that function more in upcoming screen shots). Choose "CREATE A DJ BOOTH" to create a music lounge and set the settings for others to join.

Once "CREATE A DJ BOOTH" is clicked, it will bring you to the following screen shot. If permissions are set to "play/pause", users who join the dj booth will have those permissons over the music player along with a "Vote to skip song" function. If permissions are set to "No Control", the only option those users will have will be to "Vote to Skip". This "Vote to skip" function is great if you're hosting a party and invite mixed groups of friends and not sure what the agreeable music vibe is. The admin/host has the feed back immediately if the joined users vote to skip.

Everytime a "DJ BOOTH" is created, an unique key is made (THIS WAS MY FAVORITE CODE TO LEARN AND WRITE IN THIS APP! This can be found in ). Once administered by the dj booth creator, this allows others to enter the music lounge via the "JOIN A DJ BOOTH" link which then brings them to a page that the unique key needs to be entered in order to give them access to join the desired music lounge.
